# QuoraMachLearning
When a user adds a question to Quora, we automatically suggest topics which might be relevant to the question. For example, a question about Dijkstra's algorithm would probably fit well under the topics "Algorithms" and "Graph Theory".  We have a pretty good machine learning system in place for generating these topics, but it could always be better. Your goal in this task is to design a question topic labeler.  The input data consists of a training dataset of  T T questions and an evaluation dataset of  E E  questions. Your labeler should suggest 10 topics for each question in the evaluation set, ordered by relevance.
